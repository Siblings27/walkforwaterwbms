      <h2>Background Info</h2>
      <p>South Sudan is a country in Central Africa and its capital is Juba. It's the most recent country to gain independence. It has more than 60 ethnic groups and over 60 indigenous languages. It has been through two civil wars, both of them happened when it was a part of Sudan. It has a population of nearly 12 million people. It has a few problems such as poverty, lack of education, government instability, and corruption. The main problem is limited access to clean water, and it's the problem that we're trying to help solve.</p>

  <!-- Problem Section -->
  <div id="problem" class="container">
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>The problem isn't just unequal access to water, it's also the diseases that come with the water. There are many waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, and dysentery. The reason there are so many diseases in the water is because of the lack of sanitation. You might think that the only effect of unequal access to water is that people could get diseases. This isn't true. Because of this problem, girls will not be able to attend school and get educated, there will be a low literacy rate, low investment in human capital, economy decreasing, government instability, poverty, and even less access to water. This cycle is endless, so we need to solve this problem and prevent the other ones from happening.</p>

  <!-- Solution Section -->

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>For the past 4 years, we have partnered with Water is Basic to repair wells in South Sudan. Our goal is to provide access to clean water to South Sudan by 2030. Our goal for this year is to raise $15,000 to help 30 villages in South Sudan.</p>
